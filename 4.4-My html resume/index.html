    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Krish Bhuva, and I'm a fourth-year student at Parul University, specializing in web development. Over the past few years, I've immersed myself in learning and mastering the skills needed to create dynamic and user-friendly websites. I find great satisfaction in bringing digital ideas to life and constantly seek to improve my expertise in this ever-evolving field.

        Outside the classroom and coding projects, I stay active by playing football and basketball. These sports not only keep me physically fit but also teach me valuable lessons in teamwork and perseverance. Balancing my academic pursuits with my athletic interests has helped me develop a well-rounded approach to life, preparing me for future challenges in both my professional and personal endeavors.</p>
